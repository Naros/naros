# Hi! I'm Chris ✋

I am a Principal Software Engineer, employed at IBM and Red Hat for the last nine years.
I have nearly 30 years of IT experience, working on a wide range of proprietary and open-source projects, with extensive experience with database platforms including Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

I am one of the lead engineers on [Debezium](https://debezium.io), an open-source change data capture (CDC) platform that transforms your database's transaction logs into events that can be published to Kafka, EventHubs, Google PubSub, and other message broker systems.
Change data capture (CDC) is one of the most efficient ways to react to changes, particularly in microservices, and communicate those changes across microservice boundaries.
If you are interested in CDC, details about implementing CDC with Debezium, or want to learn more about how Debezium is leading the industry, you can find me on [Zulip](https://debezium.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/302529-users) or the Google [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/debezium).

In addition to Debezium, I also contribute to [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io), a Kubernetes-native Java framework for GraalVM and HotSpot, which leverages the best-of-breed libraries and tools within the Java ecosystem.
Within the Quarkus ecosystem, I maintain the community-led Quarkus platform [Debezium Outbox Extension](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/tree/main/debezium-quarkus-outbox), which brings native CDC and Outbox functionality to Quarkus. 

I am also an active contributor to [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org), an Object/Relational Model system for Java Persistence.
Before joining the Debezium project to work on CDC, I was heavily involved in the Hibernate 4, 5, and 6 major release milestones while also splitting my time working on [Hibernate Envers](https://github.com/sebersole/hibernate-envers-lgpl), an audit-tracking subsystem for Hibernate entities.

Lastly, in my spare time, I enjoy contributing to the [Godot](https://godotengine.org), an open-source C++ game engine.
As a part of this effort, I work on the [Godot CPP](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) project, which provides C++ bindings for writing Godot plug-ins and tools in C++.
This provides me with an opportunity to continue honing my C/C++ skills and work with other build systems, such as CMake and SCons, among others.
