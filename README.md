# About Me
I am a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat as a lead engineer on [Debezium](https://debezium.io), an open-source change data capture (CDC) framework that transforms your database's transaction logs into events.
I am also an active maintainer of [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org), an Object/Relational Model system for Java persistence.
I have been in the industry for over 25 years working on a combination of proprietary and open-source projects, with a deep knowledge of Oracle database and complex, distributed applications.
